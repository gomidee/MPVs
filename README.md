# MPVs
No need to open your browser anymore! MPVs has got you covered!

*Listenting to your favourite sutdy Jazz video was never easier and faster (as mpvs will just play the audio for you!* :)

## What is MPVs?

It's a simple Shell script that automates daily tasks. Simply run it and make a choice. I'm still developing it but some funcionaliteis are more than ready for usage!

### Installation

Well, all you need is to have MPV installed. For MacOS, Arch Linux or Debian-based distros. Run:

**MacOS**
```
brew install mpv
cd /usr/local/bin; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gomidee/MPVs/main/mpvs && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gomidee/MPVs/main/yt.sh; chmod +x mpvs && chmod +x yt.sh; cd
```
